EV Problems
Selected Problems
— Charging Infrastructure
— Upfront Cost
— Consumers’ Fear & Awareness
The future of Energy sector is all about sustainability and reducing the harmful
impact on the environment. We are already witnessing the developments made
in this direction. A major game-changer is electric mobility which has gained the
limelight recently. Our focus towards the problems related to EVs are aimed at
promoting sustainability while curbing the major barriers.
Charging Infrastructure
The charging infrastructure problem is a significant challenge facing the
widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). In a Google search on “Top
challenges faced by EVs in India”, the top result will be the lack of charging
infrastructure.
One of the primary issues is the inadequate number of charging stations,
especially in comparison to the growing number of electric vehicles on the road.
This scarcity can create inconvenience for EV owners, limiting their ability to find
charging points easily. And even if there are charging stations, they may not be
equipped to power every make/model due to different parameters which vary
among the OEM brands.
The variety of charging speeds and technologies further complicates the
infrastructure challenge. A standardised and well-distributed network of fast-
charging stations is crucial for minimising charging times and improving the
overall convenience of EVs.
There are three primary levels of EV chargers:
Level 1: Uses a standard 120V plug and can charge most vehicles overnight.
Extra-large batteries can take 20 hours or more to charge fully. Most residential
chargers are Level 1.
Level 2: Uses 240V plugs and SAEJ1772 connectors. Most public charging
stations are Level 2 or a combination of Level 2 and Level 3.
Level 3: Uses 480V direct current (DC) fast chargers to provide the quickest
possible charge.
A DC fast-charging station can take 30-60 minutes to charge an EV battery to
80%.
A unified and interoperable system would allow EV users to charge their vehicles
seamlessly across different charging networks, improving user experience. The
existence of multiple charging standards, such as CHAdeMO, CCS (Combined
Charging System), and Tesla's proprietary Supercharger network, can create
confusion and complicate the charging experience for EV users. This diversity
may necessitate multiple charging ports on vehicles or the use of adapters,
leading to increased manufacturing complexity.
Some automakers have developed proprietary charging networks, limiting access
to their specific brand of vehicles. This approach may create closed ecosystems,
hindering the development of a unified and open charging infrastructure.
The increasing demand for electricity due to the growing number of EVs requires
upgrades to the existing power grid infrastructure. Without these upgrades, the
grid may face challenges in meeting the additional load from charging stations,
leading to reliability and efficiency issues.
Why Choose this Problem?
The lack of a well-developed and standardised charging infrastructure is a critical
barrier to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles because this is the
problem related to the fuel source of the vehicle which is the first aspect that
should be dealt with to establish electric vehicles.
A seamless, standardised, and widely distributed charging network would
eradicate range anxiety & enhance user confidence.
Solving this problem presents a significant market growth opportunity.
Companies involved in developing standardised charging solutions,
interoperable systems, and grid upgrades stand to benefit from the expanding
electric vehicle market.
Upfront Cost
The upfront cost of electric vehicles, primarily driven by the cost of batteries, is
higher than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Despite the long-
term cost savings on fuel and maintenance, the initial purchase cost remains a
barrier for many consumers. EV batteries must hold a massive charge to provide
the minimum range for most owners, requiring expensive raw materials to
manufacture.
The production of electric vehicles has not yet reached the same scale as
traditional vehicles, leading to fewer economies of scale. As the demand for EVs
increases and production volumes rise, manufacturers are likely to benefit from
cost reductions associated with mass production. Electric vehicles often involve
more proprietary technology. This can limit the standardisation of components,
leading to higher manufacturing costs.
As with many innovative technologies, EVs tend to carry a premium price tag due
to being produced in smaller quantities. Because the demand for electric cars is
still relatively small, economies of scale are not yet in place to reduce costs.
Electric cars also use new technology that is still relatively unfamiliar to many
manufacturers, which can increase production costs.
Insuring an electric car is usually more expensive than insuring a petrol or diesel
car. This is because the specialised technology used in electric vehicles can be
costly to repair or replace. Repairs may require specialised parts and mechanics,
which can increase premiums.
Developing and refining electric vehicle technology requires substantial research
and development (R&D) investments. These costs, including the development of
efficient electric drivetrains and battery systems, are factored into the initial
pricing of EVs.
Why Choose this Problem?
The upfront cost of EVs, driven by the high cost of batteries, acts as a significant
barrier to mass adoption. Addressing this issue would contribute to making
electric vehicles more accessible to a broader consumer base.
Lowering the upfront cost of EVs directly impacts consumer affordability. It also
has economic implications for the automotive industry.
As the production volume of electric vehicles increases, economies of scale are
likely to come into play. Addressing the upfront cost challenge aligns with the
industry's growth trajectory, potentially leading to cost reductions
Solving this problem also contributes to changing perceptions and increasing
awareness about the long-term benefits of electric mobility.
Consumers’ Fear & Awareness
Most car owners find that having their vehicle serviced by a dealer can be
significantly more expensive than using a qualified independent maintenance
and repair shop. With the EV industry still comparatively small, there are relatively
few trained EV repair technicians and even fewer qualified independent shops.
Working on an EV can be dangerous for an untrained technician, which means
most EV owners rely on their EV dealer for service.
While modern electric vehicles have been designed with improved battery
technology, the perception of limited range persists. This perception is often
fueled by comparisons with traditional vehicles that have longer ranges and
quicker refuelling times.
Factors such as driving conditions, temperature, and the use of climate control
systems can affect the actual range an electric vehicle can achieve. If drivers
receive inaccurate or unclear information about their remaining range, it can
intensify anxiety.
Indian consumers are still resisting the adoption of EVs, despite their long-term
economic and environmental benefits. This stems from a lack of awareness of EVs
and a general reluctance to embrace new technologies, especially in rural areas.
Why Choose this Problem?
Solving this problem involves raising awareness, busting myths, and providing
accurate information to consumers, contributing to a more informed decision-
making process.
Addressing the perceived high cost of servicing and ensuring the availability of
trained technicians can enhance consumer confidence in electric vehicles. A
positive service experience is crucial for building trust and encouraging the
broader adoption of EVs.
Range anxiety is a misunderstood concern at times & mitigating this makes EVs
more attractive to potential buyers.
The hesitancy to adopt EVs, despite their long-term economic and environmental
benefits, can slow down the transition to cleaner transportation.
